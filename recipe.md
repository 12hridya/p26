                                                  CHICKEN SOUP
Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken 
meat falls off of the bones (skim off foam every so often). Take everything out of the pot. Strain the broth.
